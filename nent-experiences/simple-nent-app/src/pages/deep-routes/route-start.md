## This is your beginning to seeing nested routes in action!

>Routes in NENT are established within the `<n-views>` element. You can use the opening and closing `<n-view>` to determine whether the route established is a sibling, parent, child or a deep route plumbing the virtual depths until you decide to stop!
>
>You can think of deep routes like an onion with an amount of layers that you yourself determined! If you'd like to see this in action click the "to child" button
