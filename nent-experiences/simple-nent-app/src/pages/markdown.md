## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to easily communicate the intentions of WHAT you want to say, without being bogged down or potentially sidetracked having to remember all the syntax of traditional HTML when trying to format information to your liking. NENT is all about giving a helping hand to people who may be less "tech-savvy" than others or simply just can't be bothered to worry about the syntax of filling out content themselves. This is why NENT provides the `<n-content-markdown>` element! Simply pull the element into the desired page with the link to the `.md` file and you're off to the races.

For instance below is the actual code for pulling in the file you're currently reading from:

```
<n-content-markdown src='/pages/markdown.md'></n-content-markdown>
```

That is it! From that simple few lines of text we are able to have all the utility of markdown at our fingertips! For more information on getting started with markdown, click [here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial)!
